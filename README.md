# <center>Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github</center>

Most of my public repositories will be my student projects (it might change with the time, for now all the non 42 related things i'm working on are private)

# <p align="center">Regarding my 42 projects in public</p>
  
If you are ending up here to check my 42 projects and that you are a 42 student, I highly recommend you to don't copy them, copying code will be a waste of time for you and for your evaluators. You won't learn anything and at a moment, you will realise that you have a lack of knowledges in some aspects and it will be totally your fault because you didn't took the opportunity to make things by yourself and you choosed the easy way.

I won't make you the moral regarding cheating, but just doing the same as some codes on github when you have a school based on a peer2peer system is stupid, you have a lot of peers, ask them if you need help.
